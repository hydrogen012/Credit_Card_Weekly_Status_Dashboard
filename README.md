The process included data cleaning, loading the data into Power BI, writing DAX queries for analysis, and highlighting key performance indicators (KPIs).

### Key Features:
- **Data Processing:** Cleaned and prepared data for analysis.
- **Data Loading:** Loaded data into Power BI from a SQL database.
- **DAX Queries:** Used DAX queries to facilitate the analysis process.
- **Interactive Dashboards:** Developed two interactive dashboards:
  - **Credit Card Transaction Report:** Provides real-time insights into transaction data.
  - **Credit Card Customer Report:** Offers detailed analysis of customer data.
- **KPI Highlighting:** Identified and highlighted key performance metrics.
- **Actionable Insights:** Shared insights with stakeholders based on dashboard findings to support decision-making processes.
- **Weekly Insights:** Provided insights based on the previous week's data for the last week of the year.

## Dashboards
### Credit Card Transaction Report

### Credit Card Customer Report
An interactive dashboard that provides detailed analysis of customer data, highlighting key metrics such as customer demographics, spending behavior, and customer trends.

## Technologies Used
- **Power BI:** For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **SQL:** For data extraction and preparation.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** For creating calculated columns and measures.

## Conclusion
